Ender 3 V2 with mods

In late 2021 I purchased an Ender 3 V2 as a first 3D printer. Within a month, it was being modified as I discovered a new world. This repo will record what I have done with my machine.

I never set out with a distinct plan. I modded as I went based on what I discovered. Some choices were misguided or not well thought through. It is hard to make judgments on what to do based on peer experience. All-in-all, this has been a learning experience, and is ongoing. There is a lot one can do with a basic Ender 3 unit, and the directions to take are many depending on what is desireable to the end user.

For myself, I am interested in quality and speed as target outcomes. As well as trying new things, and learning how different components work. Here is what I have done so far, and plan to do in the future.
